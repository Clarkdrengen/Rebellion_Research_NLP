FIN 46 requires consolidation of variable interest entities in which a company has a controlling financial interest, even if it does not have a majority voting interest. A company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity if it has either the majority of the risk of loss or the majority of the residual returns. Upon its adoption of FIN 46 for the mortgage investments as of July 1, 2003, the Company deconsolidated its investments in the mortgage entities as the Company neither bears the majority of the risk of loss nor enjoys the majority of any residual returns. No gain or loss was recognized in connection with this change in accounting. FIN 46 had no impact on the accounting or reporting for any of the other investments.   Starting in the third quarter of 2003 and for subsequent periods, the Company accounts for its net investments in the mortgage entities using the equity method of accounting as provided in Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Under this method, the net mortgage investments are adjusted through income for changes in the Companys share of the net assets of the mortgage entities. The excess of the estimated liquidation value of the investments in the mortgage entities over their net book value as of July 1, 2003 of $178,333,000 will be recognized as income over the remaining term of each of the investments.   Prior to the adoption of FIN 46 for the mortgage investments as of July 1, 2003, the principal mortgage-related assets were accounted for as follows:        Commercial mortgage loans  Interest income was recorded based on the effective yield determined at the inception of the  commercial mortgage transactions. The Company evaluated whether the commercial mortgage loans had been impaired by reviewing  the discounted estimated future cash flows of the loans versus the carrying value of the loans. If the carrying value exceeded  the discounted cash flows, an impairment loss was recorded through the operating income of the Leasing and Investments  segment. Interest income was recognized on impaired mortgage loans based on the original effective yield of the loans. Loans  that were foreclosed were transferred to commercial real estate at carrying value.           Commercial real estate  Recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 39 years.  At least annually, the real estate assets were evaluated for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows  to the carrying values. If the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value, an impairment loss was  recorded equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the impaired asset. Gains and  losses were recorded on the sale of the real estate assets through the operating income of the Leasing and Investments segment  based on the proceeds of the sale compared with the carrying value of the asset sold.           Net swap receivables  Recorded at fair value, based on the estimated future cash flows discounted at current market interest  rates. All estimated future cash flows were provided by the swap counter party, who also is the servicer of the mortgage loans  and real estate. Market interest rates for the swap inflows were based on the current market yield of a bond of the swap  counter party. Discount rates for the swap outflows were based on an estimate of risk-adjusted rates for real estate assets.  Any adjustments to the carrying value of the net swap receivables due to changes in expected future cash flows, discount rates  or interest rates were recorded through the operating income of the Leasing and Investment segment.      (4)               GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS:   Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the first quarter of each year, based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value of the units goodwill and intangible assets and the carrying value of those assets.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (In thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $21,712,000. The 2004 goodwill impairment charges of $11,492,000 were primarily related to a European automotive components business and a U.S. electrical components business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2004, intangible asset impairments of $10,220,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related primarily to several U.S. welding components businesses and a U.S. industrial packaging business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $702,000 related to a U.S. welding components business, which primarily resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2003, intangible asset impairment charges of $3,761,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related to several U.S. welding components businesses in the Specialty Systems-North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products-North America segment.     (5)               RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (In thousands)    The net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits does not include the potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Deferring the recognition of the new Medicare provisions impact is permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 106-b due to open questions about some of the new Medicare provisions and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance about certain matters. The impact of these new Medicare provisions will reduce the net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits reported above, but such reduction is not expected to be significant.   The Company previously disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 that it expected to contribute $110,985,000 to its pension plans in 2004. As of March 31, 2004, $74,994,000 of contributions have been made. The Company presently anticipates contributing an additional $35,991,000 to fund its plans in 2004.   (6)               STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:   Stock options have been issued to officers and other management employees under ITWs 1996 Stock Incentive Plan and Premarks 1994 Incentive Plan. The stock options generally vest over a four-year period.   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic value method, which does not require that compensation cost be recognized for stock options.   The Companys net income and income per share would have been reduced to the amounts shown below if compensation cost related to stock options had been determined based on fair value at the grant dates in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123).   The pro forma effect of applying SFAS 123 was as follows:   (In thousands except per share amounts)     Three Months Ended March 31    2004 2003  Net income as reported     $    290,196   $    195,377    Add: Restricted stock recorded as expense, net of tax    6,001    2,882    Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense, net of tax    (10,611 )  (8,635 )      Pro forma net income   $    285,586   $    189,624        Net income per share:      Basic - as reported   $0.94  $          0.64     Basic - pro forma   $          0.93  $          0.62     Diluted - as reported   $          0.93  $          0.63     Diluted - pro forma   $          0.92  $          0.62    On January 2, 2003 and 2004, the Company granted 792,158 and 553,981 shares of restricted stock, respectively, to domestic key employees. Compensation expense related to these grants is being recorded over the three-year vesting period as follows:   (In thousands)    (7)               STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM:   On April 20, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buy back of up to 31 million shares.       (8)                  SEGMENT INFORMATION:   See Managements Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Companys segments.     Item 2  Managements Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The consolidated results of operations for Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the changes in revenue, operating income and operating margins over the prior year are primarily due to the following factors:     Three Months Ended March 31     % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)    Operating Revenue Operating Income Operating Margins  Base manufacturing business:                    Volume-related    6.5 %  19.2 %  1.6 %    Nonvolume-related    --    5.7   0.8          Total    6.5   24.9   2.4        Restructuring    --    4.9   0.6   Impairment of goodwill and intangibles    --    (5.4 )  (0.7 )  Acquisitions and divestitures    4.0   3.4   (0.2 )  Translation    6.7   6.2   (0.2 )  Leasing and Investments    0.4   5.4   0.6   Other    (0.5 )  --    0.1        Total    17.1 %  39.4 %  2.6 %        The base business revenue increase was primarily related to a 9% revenue increase in North America, as industrial production levels continued to improve, building on growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2003. Improvement was evident in both the North American Engineered Products and Specialty Systems segments. Internationally, base business revenues increased 1%, as economic growth remained flat and capacity utilization continued at low levels in the major European economies.   Operating income improved primarily due to leverage from the growth in base business revenues and operational cost savings. Additionally, currency translation continued to have a favorable effect on income and Leasing and Investments increased income primarily due to sales of investment properties. Lower restructuring expenses and income from acquisitions also increased income.   As a result of the Companys annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, impairment charges of $21.7 million were incurred in the first quarter of 2004. The impaired assets reflect diminished expectations of future cash flows and primarily related to a European automotive components business, several U.S. welding components businesses, a U.S. electrical components business, and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats. Impairment charges were $17.2 million higher in 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003.

This segment primarily serves the construction, automotive and general industrial markets.   The results of operations for the Engineered Products  North America segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the changes in revenue, operating income and operating margins over the prior year are primarily due to the following factors:     Three Months Ended March 31     % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)    Operating Revenue Operating Income Operating Margins  Base manufacturing business:                    Volume-related    6.6 %  18.8 %  1.7 %    Nonvolume-related    --    (1.0 )  (0.1 )         Total    6.6   17.8   1.6        Restructuring    --    5.1   0.7   Impairment of goodwill and intangibles    --    (5.6 )  (0.7 )  Acquisitions and divestitures    (0.7 )  1.7   0.3   Translation    0.5   0.5   --        Total    6.4 %  19.5 %  1.9 %        Construction base business revenues increased 9% for the first quarter primarily as a result of growth in the residential, remodeling/rehab, and commercial construction markets. Automotive base revenues were flat in the first quarter despite a 3% decline in automotive production at the large North American automotive manufacturers. Revenues from the other industrial-based businesses in this segment increased 10% in the first quarter as they benefited from increased demand in a broad array of end markets.   Operating income increased in 2004 primarily due to leverage from the increase in base business revenues described above and lower restructuring expenses. These favorable factors were offset by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $7 million related primarily to the goodwill of a U.S. electrical components business and the trademarks and brands of a U.S. manufacturer of clean room mats.   ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL   Businesses in this segment are located outside North America and manufacture a variety of short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, as well as specialty products for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented, value-added products become part of the customers products and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of less than 30 days.    In the plastic and metal components and fasteners category, products include:   metal fasteners and fastening tools for the commercial and residential construction industries; laminate products for the commercial and residential construction industries and furniture markets; metal fasteners for automotive, appliance and general industrial applications; metal components for automotive, appliance and general industrial applications; plastic components for automotive, appliance, furniture and electronics applications; and plastic fasteners for automotive, appliance and electronics applications.

This segment primarily serves the construction, automotive and general industrial markets.   The results of operations for the Engineered Products  International segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the changes in revenue, operating income and operating margins over the prior year are primarily due to the following factors:     Three Months Ended March 31     % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)    Operating Revenue Operating Income Operating Margins  Base manufacturing business:                    Volume-related    6.0 %  22.5 %  1.6 %    Nonvolume-related    --    12.9   1.3          Total    6.0   35.4   2.9        Restructuring    --    6.7   0.7   Impairment of goodwill and intangibles    --    (20.0 )  (2.0 )  Acquisitions and divestitures    3.0   3.0   --   Translation    18.6   25.6   0.3        Total    27.6 %  50.7 %  1.9 %        Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2004 mainly due to increased base business revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation, primarily as a result of the Euro strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. The base business revenue increase in 2004 was primarily the result of a 5% increase in construction revenues due to a rise in commercial construction activity in Europe as well as increased commercial and residential demand in the Australasia region. In addition, automotive revenues grew 9% due to increased penetration at the European automotive manufacturers. Other businesses in this segment serve a broad array of industrial and commercial markets, and revenues from these businesses increased 3% in the first quarter of 2004.   Operating income in 2004 increased primarily due to leverage from the increase in base revenues described above, reduced operating expenses, lower restructuring expenses, and favorable effect of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by goodwill impairment charges of $8.5 million incurred in the first quarter primarily related to diminished cash flow expectations of a European automotive components business.

The results of operations for the Specialty Systems  North America segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      In the first quarter of 2004, the changes in revenue, operating income and operating margins over the prior year are primarily due to the following factors:     Three Months Ended March 31     % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)    Operating Revenue Operating Income Operating Margins  Base manufacturing business:                    Volume-related    11.4 %  33.9 %  2.8 %    Nonvolume-related    --    3.4   0.4          Total    11.4   37.3   3.2        Restructuring    --    (0.1 )  --   Impairment of goodwill and intangibles    --    (2.0 )  (0.3 )  Acquisitions and divestitures    5.1   4.3   (0.2 )  Translation    0.8   0.7   --        Total    17.3 %  40.2 %  2.7 %        Base business revenue growth in the first quarter of 2004 is primarily due to an increase in end market demand throughout the businesses that this segment serves. Welding revenues increased 28% , industrial packaging revenues increased 11%, food equipment revenues increased 1%, and revenues in the other businesses in this segment increased 8%.   Operating income increased in 2004 primarily due to leverage from the operating revenue increases described above. In addition, lower base operating costs and acquisitions contributed to operating income. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $6 million reduced income in 2004. These charges primarily related to the diminished cash flow expectations at two welding businesses and an industrial packaging unit.   SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  INTERNATIONAL   Businesses in this segment are located outside North America and design and manufacture longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, as well as specialty equipment for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented, value-added products become part of the customers processes and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of more than 30 days.    In the machinery and related consumables category, products include:   industrial packaging equipment and plastic and steel strapping for the bundling and shipment of a variety of products for customers in numerous end markets; welding equipment and metal consumables for a variety of end market users; equipment and plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles for the food and beverage industry; plastic bottle sleeves and related equipment for the food and beverage industry; plastic stretch film and related packaging equipment for various industrial purposes; paper and plastic products used to protect shipments of goods in transit; and foil and film and related equipment used to decorate a variety of consumer products.      In the specialty products category, products include:   commercial food equipment such as dishwashers, refrigerators, mixers, ovens, food slicers and specialty scales for use by restaurants, institutions and supermarkets; paint spray equipment for a variety of general industrial applications; static control equipment for electronics and industrial applications; and airport ground power generators for commercial and military applications.   This segment primarily serves the general industrial, food retail and service, and food and beverage markets.     The results of operations for the Specialty Systems  International segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the changes in revenue, operating income and operating margins over the prior year are primarily due to the following factors:     Three Months Ended March 31     % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)    Operating Revenue Operating Income Operating Margins  Base manufacturing business:                    Volume-related    (3.1) %  (12.9 )%  (0.9 )%    Nonvolume-related    --    21.9   2.1          Total    (3.1 )  9.0   1.2        Restructuring    --    19.2   1.8   Impairment of goodwill and intangibles    --    (0.7 )  (0.1 )  Acquisitions and divestitures    10.5   8.2   (0.5 )  Translation    16.3   19.6   (0.1 )       Total    23.7%   55.3 %  2.3 %        Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2004 due to favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the Euro strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. In addition, acquisitions increased revenues, primarily as a result of the July 2003 acquisition of an Asian manufacturer of welding consumables. Base revenues declined in 2004 primarily due to a 4% and 2% decline in base revenues in the food equipment and industrial packaging businesses, respectively. Other base business revenues in this segment declined 3%.   Operating income increased in 2004 as a result of favorable currency translation, lower restructuring expenses, acquisitions and the reduction of base business operating costs. The operational cost savings were mainly due to cost reductions related to the last four quarters of restructuring which amounted to $28 million for this segment or 51% of the Companys total restructuring expense in 2003.   LEASING AND INVESTMENTS   Businesses in this segment make investments in mortgage entities, leases of telecommunications, aircraft, air traffic control and other equipment, properties and property developments, affordable housing, and a venture capital fund. As a result of the Companys strong cash flow, the Company has historically had excess funds to make opportunistic investments that meet the Companys desired returns. In connection with some of these investment transactions, the Company may be contractually required to make future cash payments related to affordable housing contributions, venture fund capital contributions or the redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries. See the Companys Annual Report to Stockholders for further information regarding these cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003.   The results of operations for the Leasing and Investments segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows:   (In thousands)    Operating income (loss) by investment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 was as follows:   (In thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, operating income increased primarily due to gains of $19.0 million on the sales of five mortgage investment properties.   On July 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  (FIN 46) relative to its investments in mortgage entities. See the Investments note for further discussion of this change in accounting for these investments.   OPERATING REVENUES   The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:   (In thousands)    AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company no longer amortizes goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the first quarter of each year, based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value of the units goodwill and intangible assets and the carrying value of those assets.     Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets were as follows:   (In thousands)    In the first quarter of 2004, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $21.7 million. The 2004 goodwill impairment charges of $11.5 million were primarily related to a European automotive components business and a U.S. electrical components business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2004, intangible asset impairments of $10.2 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related primarily to several U.S. welding components businesses and a U.S. industrial packaging business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $0.7 million related to a U.S. welding components business, which primarily resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2003, intangible asset impairment charges of $3.8 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related to several U.S. welding components businesses in the Specialty Systems-North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products-North America segment.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense decreased to $15.9 million in the first three months of 2004 from $17.4 million in 2003 primarily due to lower foreign exchange hedge contract discounts.   OTHER INCOME   Other income increased to $7.7 million for the first three months of 2004 from $3.3 million in 2003. This increase is primarily due to higher interest income in 2004 mainly from interest received related to a tax reimbursement in Germany. Also, losses on sales of fixed assets were smaller in 2004 versus 2003.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations of $290.0 million ($0.93 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2004 was 45% higher than the 2003 income from continuing operations of $199.5 million ($0.65 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the first three months of 2004 increased operating revenues for the first three months of 2004 by approximately $155 million and increased earnings by approximately 5 cents per diluted share.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout objective of 25-30% of the last three years average net income. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth, small-to-medium sized acquisitions, additional investments, and the Companys stock repurchase program.   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by its operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, debt repayment and additional investments. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   Summarized cash flow information for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:   (In thousands)    Free operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2004 was higher than the same period in 2003 as a result of higher cash flow from operating activities. Net cash from operations was higher mainly due to higher net income and increasing taxes payable in the first quarter of 2004, partially offset by higher accounts receivable outstanding.   On April 20, 2004 the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buy back of up to 31 million shares. The Company intends to utilize its current cash on hand to repurchase between 17-21 million shares in the first 12 months of the program. The repurchase of the remaining 10-14 million shares under the authorization will be dependent on future market conditions and available cash.   Return on Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of the operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    The 370 basis point increase in ROIC in the first quarter of 2004 was due primarily to a 42% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased base business operating income and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 34% in the first quarter of 2004 from 35% in the first quarter of 2003.     Working Capital   Net working capital at March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    Trade receivables increased due to strong sales in the first three months of 2004 as well as currency translation and acquisitions. Other current liabilities increased primarily as a result of increased income taxes payable, due mainly to the timing of U.S. estimated tax payments.   Debt   Total debt at March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    Stockholders Equity   The changes to stockholders equity during 2004 were as follows:   (In thousands)          Total stockholders' equity, December 31, 2003     $  7,874,286    Income from continuing operations    290,025    Income from discontinued operations    171    Cash dividends declared    (74,029 )  Exercise of stock options    14,552    Restricted stock activity    8,263    Shares issued for acquisitions    1,628    Currency translation adjustments    119,220       Total stockholders' equity, March 31, 2004   $  8,234,116          FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This  document contains forward-looking   statements  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  including,  without  limitation,  statements regarding the adequacy of internally  generated  funds,  the meeting of dividend payment  objectives,  and the  Companys  portion  of future  contributions related to the pension  plans.  These  statements  are subject to certain risks, uncertainties,  and other  factors,  which could cause actual  results to differ materially from those  anticipated,  including,  without  limitation,  the risks described  herein.  Important  factors that may influence future results include (1) a downturn in the construction,  automotive, general industrial, food retail and service, or commercial real estate markets,  (2) deterioration in global and domestic business and economic  conditions,  particularly in North America,  the European Community or Australia,  (3) the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations,  (4) an interruption in, or reduction in, introducing new products into the  Companys  product line, and (5) an unfavorable  environment  for making  acquisitions  or  dispositions,  domestic and  international,  including adverse  accounting or regulatory  requirements and market values of candidates.
