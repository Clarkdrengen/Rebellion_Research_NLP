Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 142,  the  Company  no  longer  amortizes  goodwill  and  intangibles  that have indefinite  lives.  SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related  reporting unit or intangible  asset. The Company will perform its annual impairment assessment in the first quarter of each year.  As the first step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process,  the Company assigned its recorded  goodwill and intangibles to approximately 300 of its 600 reporting units based on the operating  unit which includes the business  acquired.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying  value.  Fair values  were  determined  by  discounting  estimated  future  cash  flows at the Company's  estimated  cost of capital of 10%.  Estimated  future cash flows were based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant  operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less  than  its  carrying  value,  an  impairment  loss is  recorded  for the difference  between the fair value of the unit's goodwill and intangible  assets and the carrying value of those assets.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill  was reduced by $254,582,000  and  intangible  assets  were  reduced  by  $8,234,000, and  a net after-tax  impairment  charge of  $221,890,000  ($0.72  per  diluted  share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter  of  2002.  The  impairment  charge  was  related  to  approximately  40 businesses  and primarily  resulted from  evaluating  impairment  under SFAS 142 based on  discounted  cash flows,  instead of using  undiscounted  cash flows as required by the previous accounting standard.  In the first  quarter of 2003,  the  Company  performed  its  annual  impairment evaluation  under SFAS 142,  which  resulted in goodwill  impairment  expense of $702,000. This impairment charge was mainly related to a U.S. welding components business.  Intangible  expense was  $8,608,000 for the first quarter of 2003 and $4,872,000 for the first  quarter  of 2002.  Included  in  intangible  expense in the first quarter of 2003 are  impairment  charges of $3,761,000 for trademarks and brands related to several U.S. welding  components  businesses and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats.  (5) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:  Stock options have been issued to officers and other management  employees under ITW's 1996 Stock  Incentive Plan and Premark's  1994  Incentive  Plan. The stock options generally vest over a four-year period.  The Company accounts for stock-based  compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic  value method,  which does not require that  compensation  cost be recognized.  The  Company's  net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the amounts shown below if compensation cost had been determined based on fair value at the  grant  dates  in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS 123").  The pro forma net income effect of applying SFAS 123 was as follows:  (In thousands except per share amounts)                                                           Three months ended                                                               March 31                                                       -------------------------                                                         2003             2002                                                       --------         -------- Net income (loss), as reported                        $195,377         $(23,443) Add: Restricted stock recorded as  expense, net of tax                                     2,882                - Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation  expense, net of tax                                    (8,635)          (6,189)                                                       --------         -------- Pro forma net income (loss)                           $189,624         $(29,632)                                                       ========         ======== Net income (loss) per share:   Basic - as reported                                    $0.64           $(0.08)   Basic - pro forma                                      $0.62           $(0.10)   Diluted - as reported                                  $0.63           $(0.08)   Diluted - pro forma                                    $0.62           $(0.10)  On January 2, 2003, the Company  granted  792,158 shares of restricted  stock to domestic  officers and other key  management  employees.

(6) NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  In 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46").  The  Company is  required  to adopt FIN 46 in the third  quarter of 2003.  FIN 46 requires  consolidation  of entities in which the Company does not have a  majority  voting  interest  but is deemed to be the party  which has the majority of the  benefits  or risk of loss in the entity.  The Company is in the process  of  reviewing  its  investments  to  determine  if any of them would be impacted by the  adoption of FIN 46.  Although  this FIN 46 analysis has not yet been  completed,  the Company expects that the adoption of FIN 46 will result in the  deconsolidation  of the  Company's  mortgage-related  investments  and  the consolidation of its property development partnership investments. The Company's risk of loss related to these  investments is generally  limited to the carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2002.    Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The Company's  consolidated  results of operations for the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows:  (Dollars in thousands)                                                  Three months ended                                                       March 31                                            --------------------------------                                               2003                 2002                                            ----------           ---------- Operating revenues                         $2,313,790           $2,204,654  Operating income                              321,000              309,899  Margin %                                       13.9%                14.1%  Operating revenues increased 5% in the 2003 first quarter versus the 2002 comparable  period  mainly  due  to  a  5%  increase  from  favorable   currency translation and a 2% increase from acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a 2% decline  in base  business  revenues,  which  resulted  from a 4% decline  in North  America  and 3%  growth  internationally.  In North  America, industrial  production  remained at depressed levels and, as a result,  capacity utilization and capital spending remained weak. Consequently,  many of the North American end markets that the Company's  businesses  serve continued to be weak. Internationally,  economic  conditions  continued  to be stronger  than in North America,  particularly  in the automotive  and  construction  markets.  However, international capital spending was still fairly weak.  Operating income increased 4% in the first quarter of 2003. This increase was  the  net  effect  of  the  following  factors.  First,  favorable  currency translation  increased  income  4%.  Second,  the 2%  decline  in base  business revenues   reduced  income  5%  due  to  operating   leverage.   Third,   higher corporate-related  expenses  associated with pensions,  restricted  shares,  and goodwill and intangible  impairment  reduced  income by 6% (see below).  Fourth, operational  cost savings  increased  income by 9%. Lastly,  acquisitions net of divestitures increased income 1%.  Pension  expense  increased  $11.3 million  primarily due to the lowering of the asset  return  (from  11% to  8%)  and  discount  rate  (from  7.25%  to  6.60%) assumptions for the principal  domestic plans.  Compensation  expense  increased $4.4 million due to the  granting of  restricted  shares to domestic  management employees on January 2, 2003  in lieu of the normal  annual stock option grant. Intangible  impairment  charges of $4.5 million were the result of the Company's annual impairment  testing of its $2.6 billion of goodwill and intangibles.  The impaired  assets  reflect  diminished  expectations  of future cash  flows,  and primarily related to several U.S. welding components businesses.  Operational  cost  savings  mainly  resulted  from the benefits of the last four quarters of restructuring  activity,  which amounted to $55.1 million in expense related  to 70  different  projects.  In  addition,  a $5  million  fixed  asset impairment  charge was  incurred  in the first  quarter  of 2002,  which was not repeated in the current quarter.  Operating margins declined 20 basis points due to the above factors. Base business revenue  declines reduced margins by 50 basis points,  operational cost savings  in excess of higher  corporate-related  expenses  increased  margins 40 basis points and acquisitions diluted margins 10 basis points.

This  segment  primarily  serves  the   construction,   automotive  and  general industrial markets.  The results of operations  for the Engineered  Products - North America  segment for the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows:  (Dollars in thousands)                                                  Three months ended                                                       March 31                                            --------------------------------                                               2003                 2002                                            ----------           ---------- Operating revenues                          $748,785             $736,461  Operating income                             111,146              124,778  Margin %                                      14.8%                16.9%  Operating  revenues  increased 2% in the first quarter of 2003 mainly due to a 3% increase from acquisitions,  partially offset by a base business revenue decline of 2%. The base business revenue decline was a result of a 5% decline in construction   revenues   resulting  from   continued   weakness  in  commercial construction and slowing residential construction activity.  Although automotive revenues grew 3% in the first quarter, this growth rate was slower than the past quarters  due  to  reduced  automotive  production.   Revenues  from  the  other businesses  in this  segment  declined 1% due to continued  sluggishness  in the broad array of industrial and commercial markets that these businesses serve.  Operating income declined 11% in the first quarter of 2003, mainly due to the following  factors.  First,  higher  restructuring  costs reduced income 5%. Second,  the 2%  decline  in base  business  revenues  reduced  income 4% due to operating  leverage.  Third, higher  corporate-related  expenses of $5.4 million associated with pensions,  restricted shares and intangible  impairment  charges reduced income by 4%. Fourth,  operational  cost savings  increased income by 2% mainly  due to the  first  quarter  benefits  from the  last  four  quarters  of restructuring  activity,  which  amounted  to $6.4  million in expense  for this segment. Lastly, acquisitions increased income 1%.  Operating  margins  declined 210 basis  points due to the above  factors. Higher  restructuring  costs reduced  margins by 80 basis points,  base business revenue  declines  reduced  margins 50 basis  points,  higher  corporate-related expenses net of  operational  cost savings  lowered  margins 40 basis points and acquisitions diluted margins 40 basis points.

The base business  revenue  increase  was  a  result  of a 3%  increase  in  construction revenues,  mainly resulting from higher commercial  construction activity in the Australasia region. Although automotive revenues grew 4% in the first quarter of 2003,  this growth rate was slower than past  quarters  due to reduced  European automotive  production.  Other businesses in this segment serve a broad array of industrial and commercial markets,  and revenues from these businesses increased 9%.  Operating  income  increased  50% in the first quarter of 2003 mainly due to the following factors.  First,  favorable currency translation increased income 21%. Second,  the 5% growth in base  business  revenues  increased  income 23% due to operating leverage. Third, higher restructuring costs reduced income 5%. Fourth, higher corporate-related  expenses of $2.4 million related to higher pension and restricted  share expenses  reduced income 9%. Fifth,  operational  cost savings increased  income 19%.  These  operational  cost savings were mainly due to a $5 million  fixed  asset  impairment  reflected  in last  year's  results  and cost reductions  related to the last four quarters of restructuring  activity,  which amounted  to $2.4  million in expense  for this  segment.  Lastly,  acquisitions increased income 1%.  Operating  margins  increased 190 basis points due to the above factors.  Higher base business revenues  increased margins by 150 basis points,  operational cost savings  net of higher  corporate-related  expenses  increased  margins 80 basis points,   currency  translation   increased  margins  20  basis  points,  higher restructuring  expense reduced margins 40 basis points and acquisitions  diluted margins 10 basis points.  SPECIALTY SYSTEMS - NORTH AMERICA  Businesses  in this  segment  are  located  in  North  America  and  design  and manufacture  longer  lead-time  machinery  and related  consumables,  as well as specialty  equipment for a diverse customer base. These  commercially  oriented, value-added  products  become  part of the  customers'  production  process  and typically  are  manufactured  and  delivered in a period of time of more than 30 days.  In the machinery and related consumables category, products include:  o  industrial packaging equipment and plastic and steel strapping for the     bundling and shipment of a variety of products for customers in numerous     end markets;  o  welding equipment and metal consumables for a variety of end market users;  o  equipment and plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles for the     food and beverage industry;  o  plastic bottle sleeves and related equipment for the food and beverage     industry;  o  plastic stretch film and related packaging equipment for various industrial     purposes;  o  paper and plastic products used to protect shipments of goods in transit;  o  marking tools and inks for various end users; and  o  foil and film and related equipment used to decorate a variety of consumer     products.

This segment primarily serves the food retail and service,  general  industrial, construction, and food and beverage markets.  The results of operations for the Specialty  Systems - North America segment for the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows:  (Dollars in thousands)                                    Three months ended                                        March 31                              -----------------------------                                2003                 2002                              --------             -------- Operating revenues           $785,716             $827,184  Operating income              111,340              111,127  Margin %                        14.2%                13.4%  Operating  revenues  decreased  5% in the first  quarter of 2003 over the prior  year,  mainly  due to a 6% decline in base  business  revenues  partially offset by a revenue  increase of 1% from acquired  companies.  The 6% decline in base business revenues was a result of continued low capacity utilization in the various  markets  this  segment  serves,  which has  resulted in slow demand for capital equipment,  and continued low industrial production activity,  which has reduced demand for consumable  products.  This lower market demand was reflected in  declines  in food  equipment  revenues  of 12%,  welding  revenues of 5% and marking and decorating revenues of 11%. Industrial  packaging revenues were even with the prior year.  Operating  income  in the first  quarter  of 2003 was even with the prior year as a result of the following factors.  First, lower  restructuring costs in 2003  increased  income 10%.  Second,  the 6% decline in base business  revenues reduced income 19% due to operating leverage.  Third,  higher  corporate-related expenses  of $9.0  million  associated  with  pensions,  restricted  shares  and impairments  of goodwill and  intangible  assets  reduced  income by 8%. Fourth, operational cost savings increased income 16% mainly due to cost savings related to the last four quarters of  restructuring  activity,  which  amounted to $30.4 million in expense for this segment. Lastly, acquisitions increased income 2%.  Operating  margins  increased 80 basis  points due to the above  factors. Lower  restructuring  costs increased margins by 140 basis points, base business revenue declines  reduced margins by 180 basis points,  operational cost savings in excess of  higher  corporate-related  expenses  increased  margins  110 basis points and acquisitions increased margins 10 basis points.

Base  business  revenues increased by 1% primarily as a result of improved European industrial production activity.  However,  low  European  capacity  utilization  continued  to  dampen equipment demand.  Industrial  packaging  revenues  increased 6%, food equipment revenues were flat and specialty equipment revenues declined 5%.  Operating income  increased 34% in the first quarter of 2003,  mainly due to the following factors. First, currency translation increased income 22%. Second, the 1% increase  in base  business  revenues  increased  income 2% due to  operating leverage.  Third, higher restructuring expense reduced income 6%. Fourth, higher corporate-related  expenses of $2.8 million  resulting  from higher  pension and restricted share expenses  reduced income 10%. Fourth,  operational cost savings of 23% offset the above  increases.  These  operational cost savings were mainly due to cost  reductions  related  to the last  four  quarters  of  restructuring activity,  which  amounted to $15.9 million in expense in this segment.  Lastly, acquisitions net of divestitures increased income 2%.  Operating  margins  increased 120 basis points due to the above factors.  Higher base business revenues  increased  margins by 10 basis points,  operational cost savings net of higher  corporate-related  expenses  increased  margins 110 basis points,   currency  translation   increased  margins  30  basis  points,  higher restructuring  expense reduced margins 50 basis points and acquisitions enhanced margins 20 basis points.  LEASING AND INVESTMENTS  Businesses in this segment make  opportunistic  investments in  mortgage-related assets,  leveraged and direct financing leases of  telecommunications,  aircraft and other equipment,  properties and property developments,  affordable housing, and a venture  capital fund. As a result of the Company's  strong cash flow, the Company has historically had excess funds to make opportunistic investments that meet the Company's desired financial  returns.  In connection with some of these investment  transactions,  the  Company  may be  contractually  required to make future cash payments related to affordable housing  contributions,  venture fund capital contributions or the redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries.

Income from leases  increased due to income from telecommunications  leases which were entered into at the end of the first  quarter  of 2002.  Operating  income  from  other  investments  increased primarily  due  to  lower  interest   expense  related  to  affordable   housing investments.  OPERATING REVENUES  The  reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:                                             Three months ended                                                 March 31                                        -------------------------                                           2003           2002                                        ----------     ---------- Engineered Products - North America    $  748,785     $  736,461 Engineered Products - International       405,512        332,033 Specialty Systems - North America         785,716        827,184 Specialty Systems - International         425,394        365,594 Leasing and Investments                    30,450         32,096                                        ----------     ----------   Total segment operating revenues      2,395,857      2,293,368 Intersegment revenues                     (82,067)       (88,714)                                        ----------     ----------   Total operating revenues             $2,313,790     $2,204,654                                        ==========     ==========  AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 142,  the  Company  no  longer  amortizes  goodwill  and  intangibles  that have indefinite  lives.  SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related  reporting unit or intangible  asset. The Company will perform its annual impairment assessment in the first quarter of each year.  As the first step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process,  the Company assigned its recorded  goodwill and intangibles to approximately 300 of its 600 reporting units based on the operating  unit which includes the business  acquired.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying  value.  Fair values  were  determined  by  discounting  estimated  future  cash  flows at the Company's  estimated  cost of capital of 10%.  Estimated  future cash flows were based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant  operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less  than  its  carrying  value,  an  impairment  loss is  recorded  for the difference  between the fair value of the unit's goodwill and intangible  assets and the carrying value of those assets.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill  was reduced by $254.6  million and  intangible  assets were reduced by $8.2 million,  and a net after-tax  impairment  charge of $221.9  million  ($0.72 per diluted  share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter  of  2002.  The  impairment  charge  was  related  to  approximately  40 businesses  and primarily  resulted from  evaluating  impairment  under SFAS 142 based on  discounted  cash flows,  instead of using  undiscounted  cash flows as required by the previous accounting standard.  In addition to the cumulative effect of change in accounting  principle recorded in 2002,  goodwill and  intangible  expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 was as follows:  (In thousands)                                  Three months ended                                      March 31                              -------------------------                                2003             2002                              --------         -------- Goodwill:   Impairment                   $  702          $    - Intangibles:   Amortization                  4,847           4,872   Impairment                    3,761               -                               -------         ------- Total                          $9,310          $4,872                               =======         =======  In the first  quarter of 2003,  the  Company  performed  its  annual  impairment testing of its goodwill and  intangible  assets,  which  resulted in  impairment charges of $4.5 million. The 2003 goodwill impairment charge of $0.7 million was related to a U.S. welding components  business and primarily resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected.  Also in the first quarter of 2003,  intangible  impairment charges of $3.8 million were recorded to reduce to estimated  fair value the carrying  value of trademarks and brands related to several  U.S.  welding   components   businesses  and  a  U.S.   business  which manufactures clean room mats.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense was essentially  flat in the first three months of 2003 versus the first  three  months  of 2002  as higher  interest  expense  from the 6.55% preferred  debt  securities  issued in the second  quarter of 2002 was offset by lower  interest  expense  at  international   operations  resulting  from  lower international debt levels.  OTHER INCOME  Other  income  increased to $3.3 million for the first three months of 2003 from $2.1 million in 2002.  This  increase is  primarily  due to gains in 2003 versus losses in 2002 on the sale of  operations  and  affiliates  and higher  interest income in 2003,  partially offset by translation  losses in 2003 versus gains in 2002 on foreign currency transactions.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Income from continuing operations of $199.5 million ($0.65 per diluted share) in the first  three  months of 2003 was 2.6%  higher  than the 2002  first  quarter income from continuing operations of $194.4 million ($0.63 per diluted share).  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  In December 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment.  These businesses were acquired by ITW in 1999 as part of the  Company's  merger  with  Premark  International  Inc.  ("Premark"). Subsequent  to the Premark  merger,  the Company  determined  that the  consumer characteristics  of the businesses in this segment were not a good long-term fit with the Company's  other  industrially-focused  businesses.  Businesses in this segment  are  located  primarily  in North  America  and  manufacture  household products  that  are  used by  consumers,  including  Precor  specialty  exercise equipment,  West Bend small  appliances and premium  cookware,  and Florida Tile ceramic  tile.  On  October  31,  2002 the  sales of  Precor  and West Bend were completed,  resulting  in net cash  proceeds of $211.2  million.  The Company is actively  marketing  and  intends  to dispose  of  Florida  Tile  through a sale transaction in 2003.  Results of the discontinued operations were as follows:  (In thousands)                                                            Three months ended                                                                 March 31                                                         -----------------------                                                           2003           2002                                                         -------        -------- Operating revenues                                      $28,622        $101,054                                                        ========        ======== Operating income (loss)                                 $(1,925)       $  8,451                                                        ========        ======== Net income (loss) from discontinued operations          $(1,932)       $  4,075 Amount charged against reserve for operating losses       1,932               -                                                        --------        -------- Income from discontinued operations  (net of tax, $2,070 in 2002)                                 -           4,075 Loss on disposal of the segment  (net of tax, $16,182 in 2003)                           (4,107)              -                                                        --------        -------- Income (loss) from discontinued operations              $(4,107)       $  4,075                                                        ========        ========  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash Flow  The  Company's  primary  source  of  liquidity  is  free  operating  cash  flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout objective of 25-30% of the last three years' average net income. In  addition,  free  operating  cash flow is  expected to be adequate to finance internal growth, small-to-medium sized acquisitions and additional investments.  The Company uses free  operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by  its  operations,  which  is  available  for  dividends,  acquisitions,  debt repayment and additional investments.
