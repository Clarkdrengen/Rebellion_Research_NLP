Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142").  Under SFAS 142, the Company will no longer amortize  goodwill and intangibles which have indefinite lives. SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles  with indefinite  lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related reporting unit. The Company has not yet  determined  which  quarter  its annual  impairment  assessment  will be performed on an on-going basis.   As an initial step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process, the Company assigned its goodwill and intangibles to approximately 300 of its reporting units.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying  value.  Fair values were determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill and  intangible assets were reduced by  $262,816,000  and a net after-tax  impairment  charge of $221,890,000  ($0.72 per diluted share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in  accounting  principle in the first  quarter of 2002.  The  impairment charge was related to  approximately  40 businesses and primarily  resulted from evaluating  impairment  based on discounted cash flows, as required by SFAS 142, instead of using undiscounted cash flows per the previous  accounting  standard. Although the Company has substantially completed its initial impairment testing, the impairment  charge recorded in the first quarter of 2002 is an estimate that will be finalized later in 2002.  The changes in the carrying  amount of goodwill by segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 are as follows:  (In Thousands)                 Engineered      Engineered      Specialty     Specialty                 Products -      Products -      Systems -     Systems               North America  International  North America  International   Total               -------------  -------------  -------------  -------------   ----- Balance,  Dec. 31, 2001  $579,462     $417,977        $853,557      $665,817   $2,516,813 Acquisitions       1,968          (39)          6,309        20,013       28,251 Impairment  write-offs      (50,992)     (18,744)        (85,994)      (98,858)    (254,588) Foreign currency  translation          32       (3,659)             (1)       (5,256)      (8,884) Balance,        --------     --------        --------      --------   ----------  March 31, 2002 $530,470     $395,535        $773,871      $581,716   $2,281,592                 ========     ========        ========      ========   ========== Intangible assets as of March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 were as follows:  (In Thousands)                               As of March 31, 2002      As of December 31, 2001                           -------------------------   -------------------------                                    Accumulated                Accumulated                            Cost   Amortization  Net    Cost  Amortization  Net                           ------- ------------ ----   ------ ------------ ---- Amortizable Intangibles:  Trademarks and brands    $ 9,239  $ (1,791) $ 7,448  $ 9,339 $ (1,685) $ 7,654  Customer lists   and relationships        28,371    (3,620)  24,751   28,371   (2,848)  25,523  Patents                   74,911   (35,878)  39,033   74,971  (34,775)  40,196  Noncompete agreements     60,252   (23,088)  37,164   63,203  (21,741)  41,462  Other                     49,219   (26,914)  22,305   50,239  (25,648)  24,591 Indefinite-lived Intangibles:  Trademarks and brands     78,134        --   78,134   82,455       --   82,455                          --------  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Total Intangible Assets  $300,126  $(91,291)$208,835 $308,578 $(86,697)$221,881                          ========  ======== ======== ======== ======== ========  Amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was $4,872,000 for the first  quarter of 2002 and  $4,679,000  for the first  quarter of 2001.

Base business revenues declined due to weakness in the industrial plastics,  construction,  machined components, polymers and electronic component packaging  businesses,  partially  offset by increased  demand in the automotive businesses.  Operating income increased 14% and margins were higher by 220 basis points due to higher sales for the automotive  businesses,  reduced costs in the construction and automotive businesses and higher 2001 nonrecurring costs.  ENGINEERED PRODUCTS - INTERNATIONAL  Businesses in this segment are located  outside  North  America and  manufacture short  lead-time  plastic and metal  components  and  fasteners,  and  specialty products such as polymers, fluid products and electronic component packaging.

This revenue  decline was primarily due to a 4% decrease  attributed to currency  fluctuations  and a base  business  revenue  decline of 3%,  primarily related to  weakness  in the  automotive,  electronic  component  packaging  and industrial  plastics  businesses.  Operating  income  declined  26% and  margins decreased 200 basis points due to the lower revenues and an asset writedown.  In addition, foreign currency fluctuations reduced operating income by 4%.

The base business  revenue  decreases in the  industrial packaging,  food equipment and finishing  businesses,  offset higher revenues in the  welding   businesses.   Operating   income   increased  2%  due  mainly  to acquisitions,  higher  sales for the welding  businesses  and lower costs in the food equipment businesses. These gains offset higher nonrecurring costs in 2002. Margins  improved  50 basis  points  due to lower  costs in the food  equipment, industrial packaging and consumer packaging businesses.

In addition,  increased revenues from acquisitions of 4% were offset by the effect of foreign currency fluctuations of 4%. Operating income decreased 20% and margins were lower by 110 basis points, primarily due to weakness in the industrial  packaging,  decorating  and  finishing  businesses.  Also,  currency fluctuation reduced operating income by 4%.

Selling, administrative,  and research  and  development  expenses  decreased to 18.8% of revenues  in the first  three  months of 2002  versus  19.1% in the first  three months of 2001,  primarily due to lower nonrecurring charges in 2002 and expense reductions  as a result of a  Company-wide  objective  to reduce  administrative costs.  AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 142, the Company will no longer  amortize  goodwill and  intangibles  which have indefinite  lives.  SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related  reporting  unit.  The Company has not yet  determined which quarter its annual impairment  assessment will be performed on an on-going basis.  As an initial step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process, the Company assigned its goodwill and intangibles to approximately 300 of its reporting units.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying  value.  Fair values were determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill and  intangible assets were reduced by  $262,816,000  and a net after-tax  impairment  charge of $221,890,000  ($0.72 per diluted share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in  accounting  principle in the first  quarter of 2002.  The  impairment charge was related to  approximately  40 businesses and primarily  resulted from evaluating  impairment  based on discounted cash flows, as required by SFAS 142, instead of using undiscounted cash flows per the previous  accounting  standard. Although the Company has substantially completed its initial impairment testing, the impairment  charge recorded in the first quarter of 2002 is an estimate that will be finalized later in 2002.   Amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was $4,872,000 for the first quarter of 2002 and $4,679,000 for the first quarter of 2001.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense  decreased to $17.5  million in the first three months of 2002 from $18.2  million in the first three  months of 2001,  primarily  due to lower commercial paper borrowings in 2002.  OTHER INCOME  Other  income  decreased to $2.1 million for the first three months of 2002 from $2.3 million in 2001.  This  decrease is primarily due to losses versus gains on the sale of operations and  affiliates in 2002 partially  offset by gains versus losses on foreign currency translation.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Income from continuing operations of $194.4 million ($0.63 per diluted share) in the first three  months of 2002 was 6.6% higher than the 2001 first  quarter net income of $182.4 million ($0.60 per diluted share).  On a  pro  forma  basis,  excluding  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible amortization in 2001, net income from continuing operations of $194.4 million in the first  three  months of 2002 was 2.3% lower  than the 2001 pro forma  income from  continuing  operations  of $199.0  million.  Net  income  from  continuing operations  per diluted  share of $0.63 for the first  three  months of 2002 was 3.1% lower than the pro forma net income from continuing  operations per diluted share of $0.65 for the first three months of 2001.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  The  strengthening  of the  U.S.  dollar  against  foreign  currencies  in  2002 decreased  operating revenues in the first three months of 2002 by approximately $31 million and reduced income from  continuing  operations by  approximately  1 cent per diluted share.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  In December 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment.  Businesses in this segment are located primarily in North America and manufacture  household products that are used by consumers, including  West  Bend  small  electric  appliances,  Precor  specialty  exercise equipment and Florida Tile ceramic tile.
