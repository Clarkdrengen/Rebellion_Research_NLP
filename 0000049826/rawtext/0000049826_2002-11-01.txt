Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 142, the Company will no longer  amortize  goodwill and  intangibles  which have indefinite  lives.  SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related  reporting  unit or intangible  asset.  On an on-going basis,  the Company expects to perform its annual  impairment  assessment in the first quarter of each year.  As the first step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process,  the Company assigned its recorded  goodwill and  intangibles  to  approximately  300 of its reporting units.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying value. Fair values were determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill and  intangible assets were reduced by  $262,816,000  and a net after-tax  impairment  charge of $221,890,000  ($0.72 per diluted share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in  accounting  principle in the first  quarter of 2002.

The base business  revenue increase was mainly due to strong demand in the automotive and general  industrial  businesses,  offset  by  lower  demand  in  the  commercial construction end markets.  Year-to-date  operating  revenues increased 2% due to acquisitions.  Base business  revenue for the  year-to-date  period was flat, as higher  revenues from the automotive  businesses  were offset by weakness in the polymers, construction, electronic packaging and machined components businesses. Operating  income in the third  quarter  declined by 2% and margins  declined 80 basis  points  as  contributions  from the  automotive  and  general  industrial businesses  resulting  from cost  control  measures  were  more  than  offset by weakness in the commercial  construction end market and increased warranty costs in  the  laminate  business.  For  the  year-to-date  period,  operating  income increased 7% and margins  increased  by 80 basis points  mainly due to increased revenues and reduced costs,  primarily in the automotive and general  industrial businesses.

Base business revenues increased for the third quarter in the  construction,  automotive,  industrial  plastics and  electronic  packaging businesses.  For the nine-month period, revenues increased 3% mainly due to a 2% increase in both acquisitions and currency  fluctuation  offset by a 1% decrease related to divestitures.  Year-to-date  base business revenue growth was flat as increases  in the  construction  businesses  were  offset  by  declines  for the automotive  operations.  Operating income increased 47% in the third quarter and 15% year-to-date,  with corresponding  margin gains of 320 and 140 basis points, respectively.  Income and margin  improvements  for both periods were  primarily related  to the  construction,  industrial  plastics  and  electronic  packaging businesses.  The automotive  business also  contributed to the income and margin increases for the third quarter. Currency translation positively impacted income in the third quarter and year-to-date period by 12% and 3%, respectively.

Base business  revenue  declines of 3% and 5% for the three-month and nine-month periods,  respectively,  were partially offset by acquisition revenue increases  of 2% and  4%,  respectively.  Both  periods  were  impacted  by base business declines in the industrial  packaging,  food equipment,  ground support equipment, and marking and decorating businesses. Operating income increased 24% in the third quarter and 11%  year-to-date  mainly due to cost reductions in the food equipment,  industrial packaging, finishing and welding businesses. Margins increased  340 basis  points and 160 basis  points,  respectively,  due to lower costs in most businesses.

The base businesses negatively impacted revenues by 3% and 6%,  respectively,  primarily  related to declines  in the  industrial packaging,  food equipment and  decorating  businesses.  Acquisitions  increased revenues by 3% for both periods while divestitures reduced revenues by 1% in the third  quarter and had a neutral  impact  year-to-date.  Translation  positively impacted  revenues by 9% and 2% for the  respective  periods.  Operating  income increased 17% for the third quarter of 2002 and decreased 5%  year-to-date.  For the third  quarter,  operating  income was  favorably  impacted by base business income and margin  increases in the food  equipment,  industrial  packaging  and finishing  businesses,  as well as a 12% increase  due to currency  fluctuation. Year-to-date base business income decreased by 6% as a result of income declines in the industrial packaging, static control and decorating businesses, partially offset by higher income in the food  equipment  operations and a 2% increase due to currency translation.  Margins  correspondingly  decreased by 50 basis points for the year-to-date period.

For the year-to-date period,  revenues decreased 8% and income decreased 7%, as revenue and income from the telecommunications leases were more than offset by losses on sales in the commercial  mortgage and equipment leasing portfolios, and a gain on the sale of a property in 2001.

Selling, administrative,  and research and development expenses as a percent of revenues in the nine-month  period declined slightly to 18.1% in 2002 versus 18.2% in 2001.  AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 142, the Company will no longer  amortize  goodwill and  intangibles  which have indefinite  lives.  SFAS 142 also requires that the Company assess  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on the fair value of the related  reporting  unit or intangible  asset.  On an on-going basis,  the Company expects to perform its annual  impairment  assessment in the first quarter of each year.  As the first step in the SFAS 142 implementation  process,  the Company assigned its recorded  goodwill and  intangibles  to  approximately  300 of its reporting units.  Then, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying value. Fair values were determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.  Based on the  Company's  initial  impairment  testing,  goodwill and  intangible assets were reduced by  $262,816,000  and a net after-tax  impairment  charge of $221,890,000  ($0.72 per diluted share) was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in  accounting  principle in the first  quarter of 2002.  The  impairment charge was related to  approximately  40 businesses and primarily  resulted from evaluating  impairment under SFAS 142 based on discounted cash flows, instead of using undiscounted cash flows as required by the previous accounting standard.  Amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets was $5,028,000 and $15,146,000  for the three  months and nine months  ended  September  30,  2002, respectively,  and  $5,994,000  and  $15,428,000  for the three  months and nine months ended September 30, 2001, respectively.  All pro forma data  presented  in this  report  reflect the  elimination  of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in prior years.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense  decreased  to $50.6  million in the first nine months of 2002 from  $53.3  million in 2001  primarily  as a result of lower  commercial  paper borrowings  partially offset by interest  expense on the $250 million  preferred debt securities issued in April 2002.  OTHER EXPENSE  Other  expense  was $2.4  million  for the first nine months of 2002 versus $2.5 million in 2001,  primarily as a result of higher losses on foreign  currency in 2002 offset by lower  losses on the sale of plant and  equipment  in 2002 versus 2001.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Income from continuing operations of $703.9 million ($2.28 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2002 was 14.5% higher than 2001 income from  continuing operations of $614.7 million ($2.01 per diluted share).  Pro forma net income from  continuing  operations of $703.9 million in the first nine months of 2002 was 5.4% higher than 2001 pro forma  income from  continuing operations of $667.6 million. Net income from continuing  operations per diluted share of $2.28 for the first nine  months of 2002 was 4.6% higher than pro forma net income from  continuing  operations per diluted share of $2.18 for the first nine months of 2001.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  The weakening of the U.S.  dollar against  foreign  currencies in the first nine months of 2002 increased operating revenues for the first nine months of 2002 by approximately  $35 million and increased  earnings by  approximately  1 cent per diluted share.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  In December 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment.  Businesses in this segment are located primarily in North America and manufacture  household products that are used by consumers, including  West Bend small  electric  appliances  and premium  cookware,  Precor specialty  exercise equipment and Florida Tile ceramic tile. On October 31 2002, the sales of Precor and West Bend were  completed.  An agreement for the sale of Florida Tile is being  negotiated  and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company does not expect to incur a net loss on the disposal of the segment.  Operating results for the discontinued operations were as follows:  (Dollars in Thousands)                          Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended                             September 30             September 30                      -------------------------   ------------------------                         2002           2001         2002          2001                      ----------      ---------   ----------    ----------  Operating revenues     $91,831        $94,477     $286,901      $288,081  Pro forma operating   income                 3,713          3,560       16,600        4,887  Margin %                  4.0%           3.8%         5.8%         1.7%  Operating  revenues  decreased  in both periods of 2002 versus 2001 due to lower small appliance revenues offset by higher sales of specialty exercise equipment. Operating income and margins  increased due to cost improvements in the exercise equipment  and  Florida  Tile  businesses  offset  by lower  income in the small appliance businesses.
