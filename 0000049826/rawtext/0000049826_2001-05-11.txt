Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses increased to 19.3% of revenues in the first three months of 2001 versus 18.9% in the first three months of 2000, primarily due to nonrecurring charges in 2001.  INTEREST EXPENSE ----------------  Interest expense increased to $18.7 million in the first three months of 2001 from $16.1 million in the first three months of 2000, primarily due to higher commercial paper borrowings in 2001, partially offset by reduced interest expense related to bonds repaid in 2000.  OTHER INCOME ------------  Other income increased to $2.4 million for the first three months of 2001 from $.2 million in 2000.  This increase is primarily due to lower minority interest expense on less-than-100%-owned subsidiaries and lower losses on foreign currency translation in 2001.  NET INCOME ----------  Net income of $182.8 million ($0.60 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2001 was 16.6% lower than the 2000 first quarter net income of $219.1 million ($0.72 per diluted share).  The Company is not expecting any material improvement in its various North American end markets until much later in 2001.
