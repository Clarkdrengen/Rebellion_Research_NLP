(4) NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:     -------------------------  In July 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business  Combinations and SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets.  SFAS No. 141 requires that all business  combinations  initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase  method.  The  pooling-of-interests  method  will no longer be allowed. Under  SFAS No.  142  beginning  January  1,  2002,  goodwill  will no longer be amortized for book purposes.  The Company will be required to annually  evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the new  statements  to  determine  their  effect on the  Company's  results  of operations and financial position.

The base business  revenue decline of 10% for both periods was partially  offset by increases from  acquisitions  of 2% in the second and 3% in the  year-to-date period.  Operating  income  declined  22% in the second  quarter and 25% for the first half of 2001 due to lower revenues and higher nonrecurring costs.  Margins declined  in both  periods of 2001 due to reduced  leverage  of fixed costs as a result of lower sales and higher nonrecurring costs.  ENGINEERED PRODUCTS - INTERNATIONAL -----------------------------------  Businesses in this segment are located  outside  North  America and  manufacture short  lead-time  plastic and metal  components  and  fasteners,  and  specialty products such as polymers, fluid products and resealable packaging.

Base  business  revenue  increased  1% for both periods as higher sales for  automotive  businesses  were offset by lower  revenues for the electronic  component  packaging and industrial plastics  businesses.  Operating income declined 13% in the second quarter and 6% year-to-date, primarily related to the electronic component packaging and industrial plastics businesses.  Lower revenues  related to  certain  end  markets  and the lower  margins of  acquired companies resulted in margin declines of 240 basis points for the second quarter and  140  basis  points  for  the  year-to-date  period.  Currency  translation, primarily  related to the euro,  reduced revenues and operating income by 7% for both periods.

Base business revenues decreased 9% for the second quarter and 8% for the first half of 2001, as slowing demand in most end markets  negatively impacted  the  welding,  industrial  packaging,  food  equipment  and  finishing businesses.  Operating  income  declined  18%  in the  second  quarter  and  20% year-to-date,   primarily  related  to  the  welding  and  industrial  packaging businesses.  Margins  declined  in both  periods  due to the  revenue  declines, nonrecurring costs and lower margins of acquired businesses.

While revenues related to acquisitions grew 2%, the topline was decreased by the effect of divestitures.  Base business revenues and operating income were flat. For the year-to-date  period,  revenues decreased 1% as the  acquisition-related  growth of 9% was offset by the unfavorable currency effect of 8% and a base business  revenue  decline of 1%.  Operating  income was flat and margins increased slightly as improvements  related to acquisitions and higher 2000 nonrecurring costs were offset by negative translation effect of 9%.

Operating  income and margins  improved  for both periods due to the effect of 2000 nonrecurring costs.  LEASING AND INVESTMENTS -----------------------  This  segment  makes  opportunistic   investments  in  mortgage-related  assets, leveraged  and direct  financing  leases of equipment,  properties  and property developments, a private equity investment and affordable housing.

For the year-to-date period, revenues and income increased due to higher  property  development  income and gains on real estate  which was held for sale.

Selling, administrative,  and research and development expenses as a percent of revenues in the first half of 2001 versus 2000 were flat.  INTEREST EXPENSE ----------------  Interest expense increased to $36.6 million in the first six months of 2001 from $33.8 million in 2000.  OTHER EXPENSE -------------  Other  expense was $.4 million for the first half of 2001 versus $1.6 million in 2000. This reduced expense is primarily due to lower losses on foreign  currency translation and higher interest income,  mostly offset by losses versus gains on the divestiture of businesses.  NET INCOME ----------  Net income of $415.5  million  ($1.36 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2001 was 15.6%  lower than the 2000 net income of $492.4  million  ($1.62 per diluted share).  The Company is not  expecting  any  material  improvement  in its various  North American end markets in the second half of 2001.  FOREIGN CURRENCY ----------------  The  strengthening  of the  U.S.  dollar  against  foreign  currencies  in  2001 decreased  operating  revenues for the first half of 2001 by approximately  $148 million and reduced earnings by approximately 3 cents per diluted share.
