(4) NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  In July 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business  Combinations and SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets.  SFAS No. 141 requires that all business  combinations  initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase  method.  The  pooling-of-interests  method  will no longer be allowed. Under  SFAS No.  142  beginning  January  1,  2002,  goodwill  will no longer be amortized for book purposes.  The Company will be required  annually to evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the new  statements  to  determine  their  effect on the  Company's  results  of operations and financial position.

The base business  revenue  decline  of 10% for both  periods  was  partially  offset  by increases  from  acquisitions  of  6%  in  the  third  quarter  and  4%  in  the year-to-date period.  Operating income declined 24% in the third quarter and 25% for the first nine months due to lower revenues and higher  nonrecurring  costs. Margins  declined in both periods of 2001 due to reduced leverage of fixed costs as a result of lower sales and higher nonrecurring costs.

Operating  revenues  decreased 9% for the third quarter of 2001 due primarily to the effect of translation,  which reduced revenues by 8% for both the  three-month and nine-month  periods.  Base business revenues were flat in the third  quarter and  increased 1% for the  year-to-date period as higher  sales for the  construction  and  automotive  businesses  were offset by lower revenues for the electronic  component  packaging and industrial plastics businesses.  Operating income declined 27% in the third quarter and 14% year-to-date,  primarily  related  to the  electronic  component  packaging  and industrial plastics businesses.  Margins declined 250 basis points for the third quarter and 180 basis  points for the  year-to-date  period as a result of lower revenues related to certain base businesses,  higher  nonrecurring costs and the effect of currency  translation,  which reduced  operating income by 7% for both periods.

Base  business  revenues decreased  9% for both  periods,  as  continued  slow demand in most end markets negatively  impacted the industrial  packaging,  food  equipment,  finishing and welding  businesses.  Operating income declined 26% in the third quarter and 22% year-to-date,  and margins  fell in both  periods  due to the revenue  declines, nonrecurring costs and the impact of lower margins of acquired businesses.

The acquisition-related  revenue growth of 5% for the third quarter and 7%  year-to-date  was  partially  offset by base business  revenue  declines  of  3%  and  2%,  respectively,  primarily  in  the industrial  packaging and food  equipment  operations.  For the third quarter of 2001,  operating  income decreased 32% and margins declined 310 basis points due to weaknesses in the industrial  packaging and consumer packaging markets.  That weakness was partially  offset by income  improvements  for the food  equipment, finishing and welding operations. For the year-to-date period of 2001, operating income  decreased 12% and margins  declined 100 basis points due to lower demand in the industrial  packaging and food equipment markets and the lower margins of acquired  companies.  Currency  fluctuations  reduced operating income by 8% for both periods.

Operating income and margins  improved for both  periods due to the effect of lower  nonrecurring costs and improved operating performance for the ceramic tile operation.

Selling,  administrative,  and research and development expenses  increased to 18.4% of revenues in the first nine months of 2001 versus 17.8% in 2000 as a result of lower sales and higher non-recurring charges.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense  increased  to $54.9  million in the first nine months of 2001 from $52.4 million in 2001.  OTHER EXPENSE  Other  expense  was $3.5  million  for the first nine months of 2001 versus $4.7 million in 2000.  The  decrease  is  primarily  due to lower  minority  interest expense  on  less-than-100%-owned  subsidiaries  and  lower  losses  on  foreign currency  translation in 2001, which was mostly offset by losses on the sales of operations in 2001 versus gains in 2000.  NET INCOME  Net income of $614.6  million ($2.01 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2001 was 18.8%  lower than the 2000 net income of $756.5  million  ($2.49 per diluted share).  FOREIGN CURRENCY  The  strengthening  of the  U.S.  dollar  against  foreign  currencies  in  2001 decreased  operating revenues for the first nine months of 2001 by approximately $229 million and reduced earnings by approximately 5 cents per diluted share.  FINANCIAL POSITION  Net working capital at September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 is summarized as follows:  (Dollars in Thousands)                         September 30,      December 31,        Increase/                             2001              2000           (Decrease)                        --------------     ------------      ------------ Current Assets:   Cash and equivalents  $  229,313        $  151,295          $ 78,018   Trade receivables      1,629,559         1,654,632           (25,073)   Inventories            1,153,220         1,181,385           (28,165)   Other                    337,123           341,749            (4,626)                          ---------         ---------          --------                          3,349,215         3,329,061            20,154                          ---------         ---------          -------- Current Liabilities:   Short-term debt          584,130           425,789           158,341   Accounts payable         405,145           455,417           (50,272)   Accrued expenses         790,893           826,107           (35,214)   Other                    176,182           110,297            65,885                          ---------         ---------          --------                          1,956,350         1,817,610           138,740                          ---------         ---------          -------- Net Working Capital     $1,392,865        $1,511,451         ($118,586)                         ==========        ==========         ========= Current Ratio                 1.71              1.83                               ====              ====  Short-term borrowings increased as a result of the reclassification of debt from long-term to short-term.  Other  liabilities  increased  as a result of higher  taxes  payable  due to the timing of tax payments.  The Company's  cash  generation  from  operations  continued to be strong in the quarter and reflected  reduced  working  capital and capital  expenditures  as a result of the slower  economy.  The  Company's  invested  capital  declined $149 million, excluding the effect of acquisitions.  Coupled with $615 million of net income, these two components resulted in free cash of $764 million. As a result, the Company  has been able to fund a $535  million  acquisition  program and pay dividends of $182 million.
