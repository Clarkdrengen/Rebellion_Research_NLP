INTERNATIONALLY, BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOFTENED OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER AS INDICATED BY LOWER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION LEVELS IN THE MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIES. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 AND 5% FOR THE YEAR TO-DATE PERIOD PRINCIPALLY AS THE RESULT OF THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 6% FOR THE QUARTER AND 5% YEAR-TO-DATE. SECOND, THE DECLINES IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES REDUCED INCOME 11% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE. THIRD, LEASING AND INVESTMENTS INCOME INCREASED BY 6% FOR THE QUARTER AND 4% YEAR-TO-DATE PRIMARILY DUE TO MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND $8.7 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES TO DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, $10.8 MILLION IN CHARGES RELATED TO PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES AT AN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING UNIT, INVENTORY ISSUES AT AN INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE UNIT AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF A NORTH AMERICAN FREIGHT FORWARDER WERE INCURRED. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $54 MILLION IN EXPENSE. YEAR-TO-DATE INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES.

LEASING AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS STRONG CASH FLOW, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY HAD EXCESS FUNDS TO MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE COMPANYS DESIRED FINANCIAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS, VENTURE FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES. SEE PAGE 29 OF THE COMPANYS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN 2003, INCOME FROM MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO SWAP MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE. BECAUSE THE SWAP COUNTERPARTY BEARS THE MAJORITY OF THE REAL ESTATE RISK RELATED TO THE MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE VIA THE SWAPS AND OTHER RELATED AGREEMENTS, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS NET SWAP RECEIVABLES INCREASES WHEN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE DECLINE. INCOME FROM LEASES DECLINED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 DUE TO LOWER INCOME FROM AIRCRAFT LEASES. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME FROM LEASES INCREASED IN 2003 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INCOME FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEASES, WHICH WERE ENTERED INTO AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, AN INTERPRETATION OF ARB NO. 51 (FIN 46). THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT FIN 46 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. FIN 46 REQUIRES CONSOLIDATION OF ENTITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST BUT IS DEEMED TO BE THE PARTY THAT HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFITS OR RISK OF LOSS IN THE ENTITY. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL RESULT IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF THE SUBSIDIARIES THAT HOLD ITS MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS AND RELATED NONRECOURSE DEBT. AFTER THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE COMPANYS MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS ($978.8 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003) AND RELATED NONRECOURSE DEBT AND ACCRUED INTEREST ($558.5 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003) WILL BE PRESENTED IN THE INVESTMENTS CAPTION OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS A ONE-LINE NET INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE OR THE ACCOUNTING METHOD TO BE USED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS NET INVESTMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS THAT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL RESULT IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS. NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANYS RISK OF LOSS RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE OF $22.3 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2003. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE DISCUSSED ABOVE, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $36.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $35.9 MILLION IN 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM LOWER INTERNATIONAL DEBT LEVELS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $5.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $4.1 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2003 AND LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS GAINS IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $483.5 MILLION ($1.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 5.2% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $459.6 MILLION ($1.49 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2001, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANYS MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. (PREMARK). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANYS OTHER INDUSTRIALLY-FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING FLORIDA TILE AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF IT THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 PRIMARILY BECAUSE 2003 ONLY INCLUDES FLORIDA TILE WHILE 2002 ALSO INCLUDES THE PRECOR AND WEST BEND BUSINESSES. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND LOWER PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH NET INCOME WAS HIGHER IN 2003, NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS LOWER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING AND LOWER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF COMPENSATION PAYMENTS. THE DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 WAS DUE TO LOWER PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND LEASE CASH FLOW IN 2003 VERSUS 2002. FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER USE OF CASH OR LOWER SOURCE OF CASH FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, INVENTORIES, AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER USE OF CASH FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AND INVENTORY INCREASES WERE SMALLER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AS A RESULT OF AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN INVENTORY LEVELS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF A PENSION CONTRIBUTION IN 2003. THE LOWER USAGE IN CASH FROM TRADE RECEIVABLES IS THE RESULT OF VARIATIONS IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO SALES FLUCTUATIONS. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 60 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 7% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE 70 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 WAS A RESULT OF A 5% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATION. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. ACCRUED EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NORMAL SEASONAL PAYMENTS OF ACCRUED BONUSES AND REBATES. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN 1999, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO JUNE 20, 2003. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003, BY A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 18, 2004. IN 1992, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $300.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF). IN 1998, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE RCF TO INCREASE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BORROWINGS TO $350.0 MILLION AND EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THIS RCF WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 20, 2008. THIS DEBT CAPACITY IS FOR USE PRINCIPALLY AS A BACK-UP LINE FOR ANY FUTURE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TO FUND LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

IN NORTH AMERICA, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION REMAINED AT DEPRESSED LEVELS AND, AS A RESULT, CAPACITY UTILIZATION AND CAPITAL SPENDING REMAINED WEAK. CONSEQUENTLY, DEMAND IN MANY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN END MARKETS THAT THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES SERVE CONTINUED TO BE LOWER. INTERNATIONALLY, BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOFTENED OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER AS INDICATED BY LOWER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION LEVELS IN THE MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIES. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 AND 5% FOR THE YEAR TO-DATE PERIOD PRINCIPALLY AS THE RESULT OF THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 6% FOR THE QUARTER AND 5% YEAR-TO-DATE. SECOND, THE DECLINES IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES REDUCED INCOME 11% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE.

FOURTH, HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PENSIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES REDUCED INCOME 2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE. FIFTH, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS INCREASED INCOME BY 5% AND 6% RESPECTIVELY. LASTLY, ACQUISITIONS NET OF DIVESTITURES INCREASED INCOME 1% IN BOTH PERIODS. PENSION EXPENSE INCREASED $5.8 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND $17.1 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO LOWERING OF THE ASSET RETURN (FROM 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 AND 10% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 VERSUS 8% IN BOTH PERIODS OF 2003) AND DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS (FROM 7.25% IN 2002 TO 6.6% IN 2003) FOR THE PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC PLANS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND $8.7 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES TO DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, $10.8 MILLION IN CHARGES RELATED TO PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES AT AN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING UNIT, INVENTORY ISSUES AT AN INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE UNIT AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF A NORTH AMERICAN FREIGHT FORWARDER WERE INCURRED. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $54 MILLION IN EXPENSE. YEAR-TO-DATE INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES. OPERATING MARGINS INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2003 AND REMAINED FLAT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABOVE FACTORS. BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINES REDUCED MARGINS 120 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND 90 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED MARGINS 50 BASIS POINTS AND 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.

THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3% INCREASE FROM ACQUISITION REVENUES IN BOTH PERIODS. THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINE WAS A RESULT OF A 6% DECLINE IN CONSTRUCTION REVENUES DURING THE QUARTER AND 5% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD RESULTING FROM CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND SLOWING RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO AN 11% DECLINE IN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION AT THE LARGE DOMESTIC AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS IN THE SECOND QUARTER. REVENUES FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT DECLINED 5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO CONTINUED SLUGGISHNESS IN THE BROAD ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS THAT THESE BUSINESSES SERVE.

BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE, AND ACQUISITIONS INCREASED REVENUES 1% IN BOTH PERIODS. THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A 1% INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 2% INCREASE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN EUROPE OFFSET BY SLOWING COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL ACTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALASIA REGION. IN ADDITION, AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES GREW 3% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, EVEN THOUGH EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION CONTINUED TO WEAKEN.

THIRD, LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER INCREASED INCOME 1%; HOWEVER, HIGHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 REDUCED YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME BY 1%. FOURTH, HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES OF $1.5 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER AND $4.0 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE RELATED TO HIGHER PENSION AND RESTRICTED SHARE EXPENSES REDUCED INCOME BY 3% AND 5% FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FIFTH, A $3.3 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO INVENTORY ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE UNIT REDUCED INCOME BY 6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, THIS CHARGE WAS OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF A $5 MILLION FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENT REFLECTED IN LAST YEARS RESULTS. SIXTH, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS DECREASED INCOME 3% FOR THE QUARTER AND 1% YEAR-TO-DATE. LASTLY, ACQUISITIONS INCREASED INCOME 1% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS. OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED 50 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND INCREASED 60 BASIS POINTS YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE ABOVE FACTORS.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING REVENUES INCREASED 17% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF 18% AND 17%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. ACQUISITIONS, NET OF DIVESTITURES, INCREASED REVENUE 3% AND 2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. BASE BUSINESS REVENUES DECREASED BY 3% IN THE QUARTER AND 1% YEAR-TO-DATE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SLOWING IN EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 AND 17% YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 22% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS. SECOND, THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DECREASED INCOME 11% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 6% YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE.

SIXTH, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS OF 5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 11% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OFFSET THE ABOVE INCREASES. THESE OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS WERE MAINLY DUE TO COST REDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY THAT AMOUNTED $18.1 MILLION IN EXPENSE IN THIS SEGMENT. LASTLY, ACQUISITIONS NET OF DIVESTITURES INCREASED INCOME 5% AND 4% FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.

LEASING AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS STRONG CASH FLOW, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY HAD EXCESS FUNDS TO MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE COMPANYS DESIRED FINANCIAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS, VENTURE FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES. SEE PAGE 29 OF THE COMPANYS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN 2003, INCOME FROM MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO SWAP MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE. BECAUSE THE SWAP COUNTERPARTY BEARS THE MAJORITY OF THE REAL ESTATE RISK RELATED TO THE MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE VIA THE SWAPS AND OTHER RELATED AGREEMENTS, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS NET SWAP RECEIVABLES INCREASES WHEN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE DECLINE. INCOME FROM LEASES DECLINED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 DUE TO LOWER INCOME FROM AIRCRAFT LEASES. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME FROM LEASES INCREASED IN 2003 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INCOME FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEASES, WHICH WERE ENTERED INTO AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, AN INTERPRETATION OF ARB NO. 51 (FIN 46). THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT FIN 46 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. FIN 46 REQUIRES CONSOLIDATION OF ENTITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST BUT IS DEEMED TO BE THE PARTY THAT HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFITS OR RISK OF LOSS IN THE ENTITY. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL RESULT IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF THE SUBSIDIARIES THAT HOLD ITS MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS AND RELATED NONRECOURSE DEBT. AFTER THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE COMPANYS MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS ($978.8 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003) AND RELATED NONRECOURSE DEBT AND ACCRUED INTEREST ($558.5 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003) WILL BE PRESENTED IN THE INVESTMENTS CAPTION OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS A ONE-LINE NET INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE OR THE ACCOUNTING METHOD TO BE USED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS NET INVESTMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS THAT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL RESULT IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS. NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANYS RISK OF LOSS RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE OF $22.3 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2003. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE DISCUSSED ABOVE, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $36.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $35.9 MILLION IN 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM LOWER INTERNATIONAL DEBT LEVELS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $5.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $4.1 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2003 AND LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS GAINS IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $483.5 MILLION ($1.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 5.2% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $459.6 MILLION ($1.49 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2001, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANYS MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. (PREMARK). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANYS OTHER INDUSTRIALLY-FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING FLORIDA TILE AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF IT THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 PRIMARILY BECAUSE 2003 ONLY INCLUDES FLORIDA TILE WHILE 2002 ALSO INCLUDES THE PRECOR AND WEST BEND BUSINESSES. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND LOWER PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH NET INCOME WAS HIGHER IN 2003, NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS LOWER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING AND LOWER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF COMPENSATION PAYMENTS. THE DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 WAS DUE TO LOWER PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND LEASE CASH FLOW IN 2003 VERSUS 2002. FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER USE OF CASH OR LOWER SOURCE OF CASH FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, INVENTORIES, AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER USE OF CASH FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AND INVENTORY INCREASES WERE SMALLER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AS A RESULT OF AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN INVENTORY LEVELS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF A PENSION CONTRIBUTION IN 2003. THE LOWER USAGE IN CASH FROM TRADE RECEIVABLES IS THE RESULT OF VARIATIONS IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO SALES FLUCTUATIONS. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 60 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 7% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE 70 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 WAS A RESULT OF A 5% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATION. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. ACCRUED EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NORMAL SEASONAL PAYMENTS OF ACCRUED BONUSES AND REBATES. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN 1999, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO JUNE 20, 2003. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003, BY A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 18, 2004. IN 1992, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $300.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF). IN 1998, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE RCF TO INCREASE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BORROWINGS TO $350.0 MILLION AND EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THIS RCF WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 20, 2008. THIS DEBT CAPACITY IS FOR USE PRINCIPALLY AS A BACK-UP LINE FOR ANY FUTURE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TO FUND LARGER ACQUISITIONS.
