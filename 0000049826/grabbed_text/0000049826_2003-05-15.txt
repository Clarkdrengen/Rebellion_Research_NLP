DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 -------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---------- ---------- OPERATING REVENUES $2,313,790 $2,204,654 OPERATING INCOME 321,000 309,899 MARGIN % 13.9% 14.1% OPERATING REVENUES INCREASED 5% IN THE 2003 FIRST QUARTER VERSUS THE 2002 COMPARABLE PERIOD MAINLY DUE TO A 5% INCREASE FROM FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND A 2% INCREASE FROM ACQUISITIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 2% DECLINE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, WHICH RESULTED FROM A 4% DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICA AND 3% GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY. IN NORTH AMERICA, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION REMAINED AT DEPRESSED LEVELS AND, AS A RESULT, CAPACITY UTILIZATION AND CAPITAL SPENDING REMAINED WEAK. CONSEQUENTLY, MANY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN END MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES SERVE CONTINUED TO BE WEAK. INTERNATIONALLY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONGER THAN IN NORTH AMERICA, PARTICULARLY IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL SPENDING WAS STILL FAIRLY WEAK. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 4%. SECOND, THE 2% DECLINE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES REDUCED INCOME 5% DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE. THIRD, HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PENSIONS, RESTRICTED SHARES, AND GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT REDUCED INCOME BY 6% (SEE BELOW). FOURTH, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS INCREASED INCOME BY 9%. LASTLY, ACQUISITIONS NET OF DIVESTITURES INCREASED INCOME 1%. PENSION EXPENSE INCREASED $11.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOWERING OF THE ASSET RETURN (FROM 11% TO 8%) AND DISCOUNT RATE (FROM 7.25% TO 6.60%) ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC PLANS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES TO DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $55.1 MILLION IN EXPENSE RELATED TO 70 DIFFERENT PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, A $5 MILLION FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, WHICH WAS NOT REPEATED IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED 20 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE ABOVE FACTORS. BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINES REDUCED MARGINS BY 50 BASIS POINTS, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED MARGINS 40 BASIS POINTS AND ACQUISITIONS DILUTED MARGINS 10 BASIS POINTS.

THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF A 3% INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION REVENUES, MAINLY RESULTING FROM HIGHER COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALASIA REGION. ALTHOUGH AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES GREW 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THIS GROWTH RATE WAS SLOWER THAN PAST QUARTERS DUE TO REDUCED EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. OTHER BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT SERVE A BROAD ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS, AND REVENUES FROM THESE BUSINESSES INCREASED 9%.

BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED BY 1% PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, LOW EUROPEAN CAPACITY UTILIZATION CONTINUED TO DAMPEN EQUIPMENT DEMAND. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING REVENUES INCREASED 6%, FOOD EQUIPMENT REVENUES WERE FLAT AND SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT REVENUES DECLINED 5%. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 34% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, MAINLY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 22%.

LEASING AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S STRONG CASH FLOW, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY HAD EXCESS FUNDS TO MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE COMPANY'S DESIRED FINANCIAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS, VENTURE FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES. SEE PAGE 29 OF THE COMPANY'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- OPERATING REVENUES $30,450 $32,096 OPERATING INCOME 17,428 16,792 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS $ 8,543 $14,742 LEASES OF EQUIPMENT 5,055 1,410 PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS 1,531 765 PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE (857) (543) VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (357) (292) OTHER 3,513 710 -------- -------- $17,428 $16,792 ======== ======== INCOME FROM MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SWAP INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. INCOME FROM LEASES INCREASED DUE TO INCOME FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEASES WHICH WERE ENTERED INTO AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. OPERATING INCOME FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS.

UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT WHICH INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNIT'S GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANY'S INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. IN ADDITION TO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED IN 2002, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 702 $ - INTANGIBLES: AMORTIZATION 4,847 4,872 IMPAIRMENT 3,761 - ------- ------- TOTAL $9,310 $4,872 ======= ======= IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS WHICH MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 VERSUS THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 WAS OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM LOWER INTERNATIONAL DEBT LEVELS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $2.1 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS GAINS IN 2002 ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $199.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 2.6% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 FIRST QUARTER INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $194.4 MILLION ($0.63 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN DECEMBER 2001, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. ("PREMARK"). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER INDUSTRIALLY-FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF FLORIDA TILE THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION IN 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------- 2003 2002 ------- -------- OPERATING REVENUES $28,622 $101,054 ======== ======== OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) $(1,925) $ 8,451 ======== ======== NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS $(1,932) $ 4,075 AMOUNT CHARGED AGAINST RESERVE FOR OPERATING LOSSES 1,932 - -------- -------- INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (NET OF TAX, $2,070 IN 2002) - 4,075 LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF THE SEGMENT (NET OF TAX, $16,182 IN 2003) (4,107) - -------- -------- INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS $(4,107) $ 4,075 ======== ======== LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS' AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 2% DECLINE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, WHICH RESULTED FROM A 4% DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICA AND 3% GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY. IN NORTH AMERICA, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION REMAINED AT DEPRESSED LEVELS AND, AS A RESULT, CAPACITY UTILIZATION AND CAPITAL SPENDING REMAINED WEAK. CONSEQUENTLY, MANY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN END MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES SERVE CONTINUED TO BE WEAK. INTERNATIONALLY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONGER THAN IN NORTH AMERICA, PARTICULARLY IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL SPENDING WAS STILL FAIRLY WEAK. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 4%. SECOND, THE 2% DECLINE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES REDUCED INCOME 5% DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE. THIRD, HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PENSIONS, RESTRICTED SHARES, AND GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT REDUCED INCOME BY 6% (SEE BELOW). FOURTH, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS INCREASED INCOME BY 9%. LASTLY, ACQUISITIONS NET OF DIVESTITURES INCREASED INCOME 1%. PENSION EXPENSE INCREASED $11.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOWERING OF THE ASSET RETURN (FROM 11% TO 8%) AND DISCOUNT RATE (FROM 7.25% TO 6.60%) ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC PLANS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES TO DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $55.1 MILLION IN EXPENSE RELATED TO 70 DIFFERENT PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, A $5 MILLION FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, WHICH WAS NOT REPEATED IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED 20 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE ABOVE FACTORS. BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINES REDUCED MARGINS BY 50 BASIS POINTS, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED MARGINS 40 BASIS POINTS AND ACQUISITIONS DILUTED MARGINS 10 BASIS POINTS.

THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINE WAS A RESULT OF A 5% DECLINE IN CONSTRUCTION REVENUES RESULTING FROM CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND SLOWING RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES GREW 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THIS GROWTH RATE WAS SLOWER THAN THE PAST QUARTERS DUE TO REDUCED AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. REVENUES FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT DECLINED 1% DUE TO CONTINUED SLUGGISHNESS IN THE BROAD ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS THAT THESE BUSINESSES SERVE.

THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF A 3% INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION REVENUES, MAINLY RESULTING FROM HIGHER COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALASIA REGION. ALTHOUGH AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES GREW 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THIS GROWTH RATE WAS SLOWER THAN PAST QUARTERS DUE TO REDUCED EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. OTHER BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT SERVE A BROAD ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS, AND REVENUES FROM THESE BUSINESSES INCREASED 9%.

THE 6% DECLINE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES WAS A RESULT OF CONTINUED LOW CAPACITY UTILIZATION IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS THIS SEGMENT SERVES, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN SLOW DEMAND FOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, AND CONTINUED LOW INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ACTIVITY, WHICH HAS REDUCED DEMAND FOR CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS. THIS LOWER MARKET DEMAND WAS REFLECTED IN DECLINES IN FOOD EQUIPMENT REVENUES OF 12%, WELDING REVENUES OF 5% AND MARKING AND DECORATING REVENUES OF 11%.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- OPERATING REVENUES $30,450 $32,096 OPERATING INCOME 17,428 16,792 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS $ 8,543 $14,742 LEASES OF EQUIPMENT 5,055 1,410 PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS 1,531 765 PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE (857) (543) VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (357) (292) OTHER 3,513 710 -------- -------- $17,428 $16,792 ======== ======== INCOME FROM MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SWAP INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. INCOME FROM LEASES INCREASED DUE TO INCOME FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEASES WHICH WERE ENTERED INTO AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. OPERATING INCOME FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ------------------------- 2003 2002 ---------- ---------- ENGINEERED PRODUCTS - NORTH AMERICA $ 748,785 $ 736,461 ENGINEERED PRODUCTS - INTERNATIONAL 405,512 332,033 SPECIALTY SYSTEMS - NORTH AMERICA 785,716 827,184 SPECIALTY SYSTEMS - INTERNATIONAL 425,394 365,594 LEASING AND INVESTMENTS 30,450 32,096 ---------- ---------- TOTAL SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES 2,395,857 2,293,368 INTERSEGMENT REVENUES (82,067) (88,714) ---------- ---------- TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES $2,313,790 $2,204,654 ========== ========== AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ("SFAS 142"). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT WHICH INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNIT'S GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANY'S INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. IN ADDITION TO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED IN 2002, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ------------------------- 2003 2002 -------- -------- GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 702 $ - INTANGIBLES: AMORTIZATION 4,847 4,872 IMPAIRMENT 3,761 - ------- ------- TOTAL $9,310 $4,872 ======= ======= IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS WHICH MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 VERSUS THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 WAS OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM LOWER INTERNATIONAL DEBT LEVELS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $2.1 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALE OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS GAINS IN 2002 ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $199.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 2.6% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 FIRST QUARTER INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $194.4 MILLION ($0.63 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN DECEMBER 2001, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. ("PREMARK"). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER INDUSTRIALLY-FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF FLORIDA TILE THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION IN 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ----------------------- 2003 2002 ------- -------- OPERATING REVENUES $28,622 $101,054 ======== ======== OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) $(1,925) $ 8,451 ======== ======== NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS $(1,932) $ 4,075 AMOUNT CHARGED AGAINST RESERVE FOR OPERATING LOSSES 1,932 - -------- -------- INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (NET OF TAX, $2,070 IN 2002) - 4,075 LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF THE SEGMENT (NET OF TAX, $16,182 IN 2003) (4,107) - -------- -------- INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS $(4,107) $ 4,075 ======== ======== LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS' AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 ---------------------- 2003 2002 --------- --------- NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 217,174 $ 282,894 PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS 15,665 11,827 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (56,173) (64,051) --------- --------- FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW 176,666 230,670 --------- --------- ACQUISITIONS (14,814) (35,347) CASH DIVIDENDS PAID (70,514) (67,084) PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS (29,138) (115,049) NET SETTLEMENT FROM SALES OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES (3,859) 1,792 NET REPAYMENTS OF DEBT (32,678) (40,873) OTHER 42,200 24,693 --------- --------- NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ 67,863 $ (1,198) ========= ========= RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ("ROIC") TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS' USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS.
