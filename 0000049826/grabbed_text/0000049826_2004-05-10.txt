SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $21.7 MILLION. THE 2004 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.5 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $10.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED PRIMARILY TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, WHICH PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS-NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS-NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $15.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 FROM $17.4 MILLION IN 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGE CONTRACT DISCOUNTS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $7.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 FROM $3.3 MILLION IN 2003. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2004 MAINLY FROM INTEREST RECEIVED RELATED TO A TAX REIMBURSEMENT IN GERMANY. ALSO, LOSSES ON SALES OF FIXED ASSETS WERE SMALLER IN 2004 VERSUS 2003. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $290.0 MILLION ($0.93 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 WAS 45% HIGHER THAN THE 2003 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $199.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 5 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, AND THE COMPANYS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND 2003 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WAS HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS HIGHER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AND INCREASING TAXES PAYABLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING. ON APRIL 20, 2004 THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUY BACK OF UP TO 31 MILLION SHARES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO UTILIZE ITS CURRENT CASH ON HAND TO REPURCHASE BETWEEN 17-21 MILLION SHARES IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS OF THE PROGRAM. THE REPURCHASE OF THE REMAINING 10-14 MILLION SHARES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE DEPENDENT ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE CASH. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND 2003 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 370 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 42% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 34% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 FROM 35% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2004 AND DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES INCREASED DUE TO STRONG SALES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 AS WELL AS CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, DUE MAINLY TO THE TIMING OF U.S. ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS.

SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $21.7 MILLION. THE 2004 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.5 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $10.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED PRIMARILY TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, WHICH PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS-NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS-NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $15.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 FROM $17.4 MILLION IN 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGE CONTRACT DISCOUNTS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $7.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 FROM $3.3 MILLION IN 2003. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2004 MAINLY FROM INTEREST RECEIVED RELATED TO A TAX REIMBURSEMENT IN GERMANY. ALSO, LOSSES ON SALES OF FIXED ASSETS WERE SMALLER IN 2004 VERSUS 2003. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $290.0 MILLION ($0.93 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 WAS 45% HIGHER THAN THE 2003 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $199.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 5 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, AND THE COMPANYS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND 2003 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WAS HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS HIGHER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AND INCREASING TAXES PAYABLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING. ON APRIL 20, 2004 THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUY BACK OF UP TO 31 MILLION SHARES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO UTILIZE ITS CURRENT CASH ON HAND TO REPURCHASE BETWEEN 17-21 MILLION SHARES IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS OF THE PROGRAM. THE REPURCHASE OF THE REMAINING 10-14 MILLION SHARES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE DEPENDENT ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE CASH. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND 2003 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 370 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 42% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 34% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 FROM 35% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2004 AND DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES INCREASED DUE TO STRONG SALES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2004 AS WELL AS CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, DUE MAINLY TO THE TIMING OF U.S. ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS.
