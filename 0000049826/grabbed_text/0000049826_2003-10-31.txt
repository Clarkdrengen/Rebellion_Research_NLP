CONSEQUENTLY, DEMAND IN MANY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN END MARKETS THAT THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES SERVE CONTINUED TO BE LOWER THAN LAST YEAR. INTERNATIONALLY, BUSINESS CONDITIONS REMAINED SOFT, AS INDICATED BY LOW INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION LEVELS IN THE MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIES. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 7% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 AND 6% FOR THE YEAR TO-DATE PERIOD PRINCIPALLY AS THE RESULT OF THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST, FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INCOME 4% FOR THE QUARTER AND 5% YEAR-TO-DATE. SECOND, THE DECLINES IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES REDUCED INCOME 7% AND 8% FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE. THIRD, LEASING AND INVESTMENTS INCREASED INCOME BY 2% FOR THE QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME FROM VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO IN THE SECOND QUARTER.

PENSION EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 AND INCREASED $17.4 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO LOWERING OF THE ASSET RETURN (FROM 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, 10% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND 9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 VERSUS 8% IN THE THREE QUARTERS OF 2003) AND DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS (FROM 7.25% IN 2002 TO 6.6% IN 2003) FOR THE PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC PLANS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND $13.1 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO DOMESTIC KEY EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $50.0 MILLION IN EXPENSE. YEAR-TO-DATE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES. OPERATING MARGINS INCREASED 40 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 AND INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABOVE FACTORS. BASE BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINES REDUCED MARGINS 70 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND 80 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED MARGINS 170 BASIS POINTS AND 80 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.

LEASING AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE ENTITIES, LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS STRONG CASH FLOW, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY HAD EXCESS FUNDS TO MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE COMPANYS DESIRED FINANCIAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS, VENTURE FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES. SEE THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS RELATED TO THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, HIGHER PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT INCOME AS A RESULT OF SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SALES OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND 2003 GAINS ON SALES OF PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO SWAP MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE. ON JULY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  AN INTERPRETATION OF ARB NO. 51 (FIN 46) RELATIVE TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE ENTITIES. SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY FIN 46. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE RELEVANT TO THESE JOINT VENTURES IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO ADOPT FIN 46 FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UNTIL THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN ADOPTION WILL BE REQUIRED. BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, IT APPEARS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CONSOLIDATION OF THESE JOINT VENTURES WOULD BE REQUIRED. SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE INVESTMENTS. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE DISCUSSED ABOVE, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $52.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $50.6 MILLION IN 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME WAS INCOME OF $9.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 VERSUS OTHER EXPENSE OF $2.4 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALES OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 ON THE SALES OF FIXED ASSETS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $753.3 MILLION ($2.44 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 7.0% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $703.9 MILLION ($2.28 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2001, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANYS MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. (PREMARK). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANYS OTHER INDUSTRIALLY FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING FLORIDA TILE AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF IT THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 PRIMARILY BECAUSE 2003 ONLY INCLUDES FLORIDA TILE WHILE 2002 ALSO INCLUDES THE PRECOR AND WEST BEND BUSINESSES. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS. NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS HIGHER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AND DECREASING INVENTORY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING. THE DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 WAS DUE TO LOWER LEASE CASH FLOW IN 2003 VERSUS 2002. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER USE OF CASH OR LOWER SOURCE OF CASH FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER USE OF CASH FOR INVENTORIES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AND INVENTORY INCREASES WERE SMALLER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AS A RESULT OF AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN INVENTORY LEVELS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF A PENSION CONTRIBUTION IN 2003. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 70 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 7% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE 90 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 WAS A RESULT OF A 6% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATION. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ACQUISITIONS. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCRUED EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF THE MORTGAGE ENTITIES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN 1999, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO JUNE 20, 2003. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 18, 2004. IN 1992, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $300.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF). IN 1998, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE RCF TO INCREASE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BORROWINGS TO $350.0 MILLION AND EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THIS RCF WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 20, 2008. THIS DEBT CAPACITY IS FOR USE PRINCIPALLY TO SUPPORT ANY FUTURE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TO FUND LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

PENSION EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 AND INCREASED $17.4 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO LOWERING OF THE ASSET RETURN (FROM 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, 10% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND 9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 VERSUS 8% IN THE THREE QUARTERS OF 2003) AND DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS (FROM 7.25% IN 2002 TO 6.6% IN 2003) FOR THE PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC PLANS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.4 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND $13.1 MILLION YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO THE GRANTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO DOMESTIC KEY EMPLOYEES ON JANUARY 2, 2003 IN LIEU OF THE NORMAL ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT. OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS MAINLY RESULTED FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY, WHICH AMOUNTED TO $50.0 MILLION IN EXPENSE. YEAR-TO-DATE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECT DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES.

LOWER BASE BUSINESS REVENUES DECREASED MARGINS 130 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND 70 BASIS POINTS YEAR-TO-DATE, OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS NET OF HIGHER CORPORATE-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED MARGINS BY 380 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND 150 BASIS POINTS YEAR-TO-DATE, CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED MARGINS 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER AND 30 BASIS POINTS YEAR-TO-DATE, HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES REDUCED MARGINS BY 250 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 120 BASIS POINTS YEAR-TO-DATE AND ACQUISITIONS HAD VIRTUALLY NO EFFECT ON MARGINS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND INCREASED MARGINS 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. LEASING AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE ENTITIES, LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS STRONG CASH FLOW, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY HAD EXCESS FUNDS TO MAKE OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THE COMPANYS DESIRED FINANCIAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS, VENTURE FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES. SEE THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE LEASING AND INVESTMENTS SEGMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY INVESTMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS RELATED TO THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, HIGHER PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT INCOME AS A RESULT OF SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SALES OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND 2003 GAINS ON SALES OF PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO SWAP MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 AS A RESULT OF LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE. ON JULY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  AN INTERPRETATION OF ARB NO. 51 (FIN 46) RELATIVE TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE ENTITIES. SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY FIN 46. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE RELEVANT TO THESE JOINT VENTURES IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO ADOPT FIN 46 FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UNTIL THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN ADOPTION WILL BE REQUIRED. BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, IT APPEARS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CONSOLIDATION OF THESE JOINT VENTURES WOULD BE REQUIRED. SEE THE INVESTMENTS NOTE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE INVESTMENTS. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS 600 REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE OPERATING UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $254.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $8.2 MILLION, AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221.9 MILLION ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD. OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE DISCUSSED ABOVE, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE EXPENSE WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION. THE 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION WAS RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $3.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS RELATED TO SEVERAL U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESSES AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $52.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 FROM $50.6 MILLION IN 2002 AS HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME WAS INCOME OF $9.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 VERSUS OTHER EXPENSE OF $2.4 MILLION IN 2002. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN 2003 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2002 ON THE SALES OF OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LOSSES IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 ON THE SALES OF FIXED ASSETS. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $753.3 MILLION ($2.44 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 WAS 7.0% HIGHER THAN THE 2002 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $703.9 MILLION ($2.28 PER DILUTED SHARE). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2001, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED BY ITW IN 1999 AS PART OF THE COMPANYS MERGER WITH PREMARK INTERNATIONAL INC. (PREMARK). SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREMARK MERGER, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT WERE NOT A GOOD LONG-TERM FIT WITH THE COMPANYS OTHER INDUSTRIALLY FOCUSED BUSINESSES. BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND MANUFACTURE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY CONSUMERS, INCLUDING PRECOR SPECIALTY EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, WEST BEND SMALL APPLIANCES AND PREMIUM COOKWARE, AND FLORIDA TILE CERAMIC TILE. ON OCTOBER 31, 2002 THE SALES OF PRECOR AND WEST BEND WERE COMPLETED, RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $211.2 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY MARKETING FLORIDA TILE AND INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF IT THROUGH A SALE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF 2003. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 PRIMARILY BECAUSE 2003 ONLY INCLUDES FLORIDA TILE WHILE 2002 ALSO INCLUDES THE PRECOR AND WEST BEND BUSINESSES. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS. NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS HIGHER MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AND DECREASING INVENTORY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING. THE DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 WAS DUE TO LOWER LEASE CASH FLOW IN 2003 VERSUS 2002. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER USE OF CASH OR LOWER SOURCE OF CASH FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER USE OF CASH FOR INVENTORIES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AND INVENTORY INCREASES WERE SMALLER IN 2003 VERSUS 2002 AS A RESULT OF AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN INVENTORY LEVELS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF A PENSION CONTRIBUTION IN 2003. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2003 AND 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 70 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 7% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE 90 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 WAS A RESULT OF A 6% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATION. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ACQUISITIONS. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCRUED EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF THE MORTGAGE ENTITIES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN 1999, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO JUNE 20, 2003. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $400.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 18, 2004. IN 1992, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $300.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF). IN 1998, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE RCF TO INCREASE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BORROWINGS TO $350.0 MILLION AND EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THIS RCF WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 20, 2003 BY A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 20, 2008. THIS DEBT CAPACITY IS FOR USE PRINCIPALLY TO SUPPORT ANY FUTURE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TO FUND LARGER ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF THE MORTGAGE ENTITIES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANYS NONRECOURSE NOTES PAYABLE WERE NETTED AGAINST INVESTMENTS.
