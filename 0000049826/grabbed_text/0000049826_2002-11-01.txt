AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ("SFAS 142"). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WHICH HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED ON THE COMPANY'S INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $262,816,000 AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221,890,000 ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD.

OTHER EXPENSE OTHER EXPENSE WAS $2.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 VERSUS $2.5 MILLION IN 2001, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY IN 2002 OFFSET BY LOWER LOSSES ON THE SALE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2002 VERSUS 2001. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $703.9 MILLION ($2.28 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 WAS 14.5% HIGHER THAN 2001 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $614.7 MILLION ($2.01 PER DILUTED SHARE).

FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 1 CENT PER DILUTED SHARE.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ("SFAS 142"). UNDER SFAS 142, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WHICH HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. SFAS 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY ASSESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PERFORM ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS 142 IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO APPROXIMATELY 300 OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THEN, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED ON THE COMPANY'S INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY $262,816,000 AND A NET AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $221,890,000 ($0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 BUSINESSES AND PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS 142 BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INSTEAD OF USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARD.

OTHER EXPENSE OTHER EXPENSE WAS $2.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 VERSUS $2.5 MILLION IN 2001, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY IN 2002 OFFSET BY LOWER LOSSES ON THE SALE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2002 VERSUS 2001.

FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 1 CENT PER DILUTED SHARE.
